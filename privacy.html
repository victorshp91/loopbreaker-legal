    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> December 26, 2025</p>

    <p>LoopBreaker ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Minimization & Local Storage</h2>
    <p>LoopBreaker is designed with a "Privacy First" architecture. All your journal entries, worry logs, and analysis history are stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> using Apple's Core Data framework. We do not have access to your personal thoughts, anxieties, or entries. They never leave your phone unless you choose to back them up via your own iCloud account.</p>

    <h2>2. FaceID and Biometrics</h2>
    <p>You may choose to use FaceID or TouchID to lock the application. This biometric data is processed entirely by the iOS system on your device's Secure Enclave. LoopBreaker only receives a "pass/fail" confirmation from the system to unlock the app. We never access, store, or transmit your biometric data.</p>

    <h2>3. AI Analysis (OpenAI)</h2>
    <p>To provide the "Reality Check" feature, anonymized text data (your worry description) is sent to OpenAI's API for processing. This data is not used to train OpenAI's models and is not retained by us. No personally identifiable information (PII) is transmitted.</p>

    <h2>4. Subscription Data</h2>
    <p>All financial transactions and subscriptions are handled directly by Apple via the App Store. We do not process or store your credit card information.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via the "Contact Support" button inside the application.</p>
